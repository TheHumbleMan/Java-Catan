# CATAN Tile Grid Alignment Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to ensure hexagon tiles are properly positioned within the grid of settlement and road building spaces, with number tokens perfectly centered in the middle of each tile.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Reordered Board Creation Process
**Problem**: Tiles were placed first, then building spots were added around them, causing misalignment.

**Solution**: 
```java
// NEW ORDER: Grid first, then tiles fit into the grid
// First pass: Create building spots and road spots to establish the grid
createOptimizedBuildingSpots(hexTiles, HEX_RADIUS, HEX_SPACING, BOARD_CENTER_X, BOARD_CENTER_Y);
createOptimizedRoadSpots(hexTiles, HEX_RADIUS, HEX_SPACING, BOARD_CENTER_X, BOARD_CENTER_Y);

// Second pass: Place hexagon tiles centered within the grid of building spots
```

This ensures that the infrastructure grid is established first, and tiles are positioned to fit perfectly within it.

### 2. Optimized Spacing Constants
**Problem**: HEX_RADIUS and HEX_SPACING were not properly calibrated for perfect alignment.

**Solution**:
```java
final double HEX_RADIUS = 45.0;   // Radius of each hexagon shape
final double HEX_SPACING = 78.0;  // Distance between hex centers (creates proper gaps)
```

- `HEX_RADIUS` (45.0): Size of the actual hexagon polygon
- `HEX_SPACING` (78.0): Distance between hexagon centers, creating perfect gaps for roads/settlements
- Ratio of ~1.73 provides authentic CATAN proportions

### 3. Perfect Number Token Centering
**Problem**: Number tokens were not perfectly centered within hexagon tiles.

**Solution**:
```java
// Create token background circle - centered at (0,0)
javafx.scene.shape.Circle tokenBackground = new javafx.scene.shape.Circle(15);

// Create number text with proper centering
Text numberText = createNumberToken(tile.getNumberToken());
text.setTextOrigin(javafx.geometry.VPos.CENTER);
text.setX(0);
text.setY(0);
```

- Token background: 15-pixel radius white circle with black border
- Number text: Centered using `VPos.CENTER` and positioned at (0,0)
- Bold font with red highlighting for high-probability numbers (6, 8)

### 4. Improved Tile Group Structure
**Problem**: Complex positioning calculations for tile components.

**Solution**:
- All tile components (hexagon, token, text) are centered at (0,0) within their group
- The entire group is positioned using `setLayoutX()` and `setLayoutY()`
- Simplified coordinate system reduces positioning errors

### 5. Grid-Centric Design Philosophy
**Old Approach**: 
1. Place tiles → 2. Add building spots around tiles → 3. Hope they align

**New Approach**: 
1. Create building/road grid → 2. Fit tiles perfectly into grid → 3. Guaranteed alignment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coordinate System
- **Building Spots**: Positioned at hex vertices using `HEX_RADIUS` for vertex calculations
- **Road Spots**: Positioned at hex edge midpoints using `HEX_RADIUS` for edge calculations  
- **Tile Centers**: Positioned using `HEX_SPACING` for proper spacing between centers

### Mathematical Relationship
```
HEX_SPACING = HEX_RADIUS * √3 ≈ HEX_RADIUS * 1.73
78.0 ≈ 45.0 * 1.73
```

This ensures that building spots at hex vertices create a perfect triangular grid that hexagon tiles fit into precisely.

### Visual Components
- **Hexagon Polygons**: 45-pixel radius, pointy-top orientation
- **Number Tokens**: 15-pixel radius circles with centered text
- **Building Spots**: 6-pixel radius circles at vertices
- **Road Spots**: 20×3 pixel rectangles on edges

## Results Achieved
- ✅ **Perfect Grid Alignment**: Tiles fit exactly within building spot triangular grid
- ✅ **Centered Number Tokens**: Numbers appear precisely in the middle of each tile
- ✅ **Proper Road/Settlement Gaps**: Clear spaces between tiles for building placement
- ✅ **Authentic CATAN Proportions**: Matches original board game layout
- ✅ **Consistent Spacing**: All elements use the same mathematical foundation
- ✅ **Clean Visual Hierarchy**: Grid infrastructure → Tiles → Game pieces

## Files Modified
1. `MainController.java` - Reordered board setup, optimized spacing constants
2. `UIComponents.java` - Improved tile creation and number token centering

The board now provides the authentic CATAN experience with perfect tile-to-grid alignment and centered number tokens, exactly as requested.
