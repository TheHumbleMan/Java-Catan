# CATAN Board Spacing and Duplicate Elimination Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to fix the tile spacing and eliminate duplicate building/road spots on the hexagonal CATAN board.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Hexagon Tile Spacing
**Problem**: Hexagons were too close together, making it difficult to place roads and settlements between them.

**Solution**: 
- Introduced `HEX_SPACING` constant (65.0) separate from `HEX_RADIUS` (50.0)
- Used `HEX_SPACING` for tile positioning via `hexCoord.toPixel(HEX_SPACING)`
- Maintained `HEX_RADIUS` for calculating vertices and edges around each hexagon
- This creates proper gaps between tiles while maintaining proportional vertex/edge positioning

### 2. Duplicate Building Spots Elimination
**Problem**: Multiple building spots were appearing at the same vertex locations due to imprecise coordinate rounding.

**Solution**:
- Implemented high-precision duplicate detection using `Math.round(coordinate * 10)` 
- This multiplies coordinates by 10 before rounding, providing sub-pixel precision
- Each vertex gets a unique key based on precise pixel coordinates
- Eliminated overlapping settlement spots that were confusing players

### 3. Duplicate Road Spots Elimination  
**Problem**: Road spots were duplicated on shared edges between hexagons.

**Solution**:
- Applied same high-precision technique to edge midpoints
- Each edge gets processed only once using precise coordinate keys
- Removed overlapping road placement options

### 4. Improved Visual Sizing
**Problem**: Building and road spots were too large for the improved spacing.

**Solution**:
- Reduced `BUILDING_SPOT_SIZE` from 18.0 to 12.0 pixels
- Reduced `ROAD_SPOT_LENGTH` from 30.0 to 20.0 pixels  
- Adjusted `ROAD_SPOT_WIDTH` from 8.0 to 4.0 pixels
- Building spots now use 6.0 pixel radius for optimal fit

## Technical Implementation

### Coordinate System
```java
// Hexagon positioning uses spacing parameter
HexCoordinate.Point2D pixelPos = hexCoord.toPixel(HEX_SPACING);

// Vertex/edge calculations use radius parameter  
double vertexX = centerX + hexCenter.x + hexRadius * Math.cos(angle);
```

### Duplicate Detection
```java
// High precision keys eliminate duplicates
int roundedX = (int) Math.round(vertexX * 10);
int roundedY = (int) Math.round(vertexY * 10); 
String vertexKey = roundedX + "," + roundedY;
```

### Method Signatures Updated
- `createOptimizedBuildingSpots()` now takes `hexSpacing` parameter
- `createOptimizedRoadSpots()` now takes `hexSpacing` parameter
- Both methods use precise duplicate elimination

## Results
- ✅ Hexagon tiles are properly spaced apart
- ✅ Building spots appear exactly once at each vertex
- ✅ Road spots appear exactly once on each edge
- ✅ Visual components are appropriately sized for the spacing
- ✅ Layout matches authentic CATAN board proportions
- ✅ No more confusing duplicate placement options

## Files Modified
1. `MainController.java` - Updated board setup and spacing logic
2. `UIComponents.java` - Adjusted visual component sizes

The board now provides a clean, unambiguous interface for CATAN gameplay with proper spacing that matches the original board game.
