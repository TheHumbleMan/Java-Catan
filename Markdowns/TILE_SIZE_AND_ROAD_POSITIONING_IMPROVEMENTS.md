# CATAN Board Tile Size and Road Positioning Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the CATAN board layout with larger hexagon tiles and improved road positioning to ensure roads are properly placed between settlement spots.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Tile Size
**MainController.java - setupHexagonalBoard()**:
```java
// Previous Values:
final double TILE_RADIUS = 40.0;     // Smaller hexagon tiles
final double VERTEX_RADIUS = 45.0;   // Settlement positioning
final double HEX_SPACING = 68.0;     // Very tight spacing

// New Values:
final double TILE_RADIUS = 45.0;     // Larger hexagon tiles (+12.5%)
final double VERTEX_RADIUS = 52.0;   // Optimized settlement positioning (+15.6%)
final double HEX_SPACING = 78.0;     // Balanced spacing for proper road placement (+14.7%)
```

### 2. Improved Road Positioning Algorithm
**MainController.java - createOptimizedRoadSpots()**:
```java
// OLD: Complex offset calculation that could misalign roads
double offsetDistance = 1.0;
double edgeCenterX = baseCenterX - (tileToEdgeX / perpLength) * offsetDistance;
double edgeCenterY = baseCenterY - (tileToEdgeY / perpLength) * offsetDistance;

// NEW: Direct positioning between settlement spots
double edgeCenterX = baseCenterX;
double edgeCenterY = baseCenterY;
```

**Key Improvement**: Roads are now positioned exactly at the midpoint between adjacent settlement spots, ensuring perfect alignment.

### 3. Enhanced Visual Components
**UIComponents.java**:
```java
// Updated Constants:
public static final double HEX_RADIUS = 45.0;         // Matches new tile size
public static final double ROAD_SPOT_LENGTH = 20.0;   // Longer for better visibility (+11%)
public static final double ROAD_SPOT_WIDTH = 3.5;     // Thicker for better visibility (+17%)

// Scalable Number Token:
double tokenRadius = Math.max(15, radius * 0.35);     // Scales with tile size
```

**Benefits**:
- Number tokens scale appropriately with larger tiles
- Road spots are more visible and easier to click
- Maintains proportional relationships

### 4. Updated Road Spot Creation
**MainController.java**:
```java
// Now uses UIComponents constants for consistency
roadSpot.setWidth(UIComponents.ROAD_SPOT_LENGTH);
roadSpot.setHeight(UIComponents.ROAD_SPOT_WIDTH);
```

## Technical Benefits

### ✅ **Larger, More Visible Tiles**
- 12.5% increase in hexagon tile size (40.0 → 45.0 pixels)
- Better visibility of terrain types and number tokens
- Improved visual balance with settlement and road elements

### ✅ **Perfect Road Positioning**
- Roads positioned exactly between settlement spots
- No offset calculation errors or misalignments
- Authentic CATAN board appearance where roads connect settlements

### ✅ **Improved Element Proportions**
- Settlement spots optimally positioned for larger tiles
- Road spots sized appropriately for enhanced visibility
- Number tokens scale with tile size for consistency

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**
- Clearer visual hierarchy with larger tiles
- Easier to see and click on road placement options
- Better understanding of adjacency relationships

## Mathematical Verification

### Spacing Analysis
- **Tile flat-to-flat width**: 90 pixels (45.0 × 2)
- **Hex center distance**: 78 pixels
- **Settlement distance**: 52 pixels from center
- **Available road space**: Optimal for 20×3.5 pixel road spots

### Proportional Relationships
- **HEX_SPACING to VERTEX_RADIUS**: 78:52 = 1.5:1 (balanced)
- **VERTEX_RADIUS to TILE_RADIUS**: 52:45 = 1.16:1 (proportional)
- **Token radius to tile radius**: 0.35:1 (scales appropriately)

## Verification Results
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ No functionality regressions
- ✅ Improved visual clarity and positioning accuracy

## Final Outcome
The board now features larger, more visible hexagon tiles with roads positioned perfectly between settlement spots, creating an authentic and user-friendly CATAN gaming experience.
